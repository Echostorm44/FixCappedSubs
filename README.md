# FixCappedSubs

 A quick and dirty no frills project to extract subtitles from videos to srt files and then sentence case the subtitles so they aren't SCREAMING.
 It doesn't currently delete the existing subs out of an abundance of caution so you're on your own to do the swap after although if you're here you're more than capiable.
